"""
BEFORE RUNNING:
---------------
1. If not already done, enable the Compute Engine API
   and check the quota for your project at
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/compute
2. This sample uses Application Default Credentials for authentication.
   If not already done, install the gcloud CLI from
   https://cloud.google.com/sdk and run
   `gcloud beta auth application-default login`.
   For more information, see
   https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
3. Install the Python client library for Google APIs by running
   `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`
